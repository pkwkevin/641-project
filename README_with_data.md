For the data, since the github cannot upload the files that greater than 25MB.

All the files in the Raw Data folder need to be downloaded and renamed separately
as "2018.csv","2019.csv","2020.csv","2021.csv","2022.csv","fin.csv" based on their
orignal file names. After renaming them, you can run the code directly when the files
are in the same directory as the code. Run Data+ML first and Execution second.
