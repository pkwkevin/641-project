For the data, since GitHub cannot upload files that are greater than 25MB. 
Here is the link to our Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1iXaIEIKG8TeeRZcKqNxMVELhWoBsluYh.
All the files in the Raw Data folder need to be downloaded and renamed separately
as "2018.csv","2019.csv","2020.csv","2021.csv","2022.csv",and "fin.csv" based on their
orignal file names (except "df.csv" does not need to be renamed). After renaming them, you can run the code directly when the files
are in the same directory as the code. Run Data+ML first and Execution second.
